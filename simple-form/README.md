```
simple-form/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Complete form (HTML + CSS + JS)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps-script.js      # Google Apps Script code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This setup guide
```

## üîß Customization

### Add More Fields
To add a new field:

1. **In HTML**: Add the input field
```html
<div class="field">
    <label>New Field <span class="required">*</span></label>
    <input type="text" name="newField" required>
</div>
```

2. **In Apps Script**: Add the field to the headers and row data
```javascript
// Add to headers array:
'New Field'

// Add to row array:
data.newField || ''
```

### Change Styling
All CSS is in the `<style>` section of `index.html`. Modify colors, fonts, and layout as needed.

### Modify Validation
Add custom validation in the `handleSubmit` method before calling `submitToSheets`.

## üìä Data Structure

The form collects these fields:
- **Personal**: Name, DOB, Age, Village
- **Education**: Level, Year, School, Future Plans
- **Financial**: Tuition Fees, Other Expenses, Total Cost
- **Family**: Father's Name, Occupation, Income, Family Size
- **Contact**: Phone, Address

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Form not submitting?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the Google Apps Script URL is correct
- Ensure the Apps Script is deployed with "Anyone" access

### Data not appearing in sheets?
- Check the Google Sheet ID in apps-script.js
- Verify the Apps Script has permission to access the sheet
- Look at Apps Script execution logs for errors

### Want to test without Google Sheets?
